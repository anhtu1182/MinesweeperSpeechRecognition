At first, I coded minesweeper game
Then, I tried to add speech recognition function
But, there are some problem
If I use window OS, I cannot install library to recognize voice
If I use Ubuntu, i can install those library but my microphone cannot use
So I found a new way - Using "window speech recognition"
"Window speech recognition" can listen my speech 
But I faced a new problem
"Window speech recognition" recognize areas in screen
But minesweeper is a area - That mean it cannot choose small square 
So, I must find a solution 
Finally, I found answer. I do not paint a board and devide it into small pieces
I paint each pieces independently. 
So "Window speech recognition" can recognize each pieces
